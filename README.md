## Hi friends. I'm Luke Posey. ðŸ‘‹

I spend my time working on [Spawner](https://www.spawner.ai), a better way to approach building and maintaining portfolios. ðŸ“ˆ 

I also work on [Dataset Daily](https://www.datasetdaily.com), a weekly newsletter for data junkies. ðŸ“Š  

If you're into Quant Finance, Programming, Startups, and especially the intersection of all three, then you might enjoy some of my writing on [Medium](https://medium.com/@posey). Or to chat with me directly feel free to follow on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/poseysthumbs) or connect with me on [Linkedin](https://www.linkedin.com/in/luke-posey/).
