## Hi friends. I'm Luke Posey. ðŸ‘‹

I'm passionate about practical applications of AI/ML, especially in FinTech. I try to strike a balance between the amount of code I ship and content I create.

ðŸ“ˆ I spend my time working on [Spawner](https://www.spawner.ai), a better way to approach building and maintaining portfolios. 

ðŸ“Š I also work on [Dataset Daily](https://www.datasetdaily.com), a weekly newsletter for data junkies.
