## Hi friends. I'm Luke Posey. ğŸ‘‹

I'm passionate about practical applications of AI/ML, especially in FinTech. I try to strike a balance between the amount of code I ship and content I create.

ğŸ“Š I spend most of my time on [Dataset Daily](https://www.datasetdaily.com), a data newsletter on markets, companies, and industries.

ğŸ“ˆ I also spend my time working on [Spawner](https://www.spawner.ai), open data for traders and investors.
