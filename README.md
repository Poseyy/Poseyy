## Hi friends. I'm Luke Posey. ðŸ‘‹

I spend most of my time on trading tools and practical applications of AI/ML. I try to strike a balance between the amount of code I ship and content I create.

ðŸ“Š I spend most of my writing time on [Dataset Daily](https://www.datasetdaily.com), a data newsletter on markets, companies, and industries as well as [Medium](https://medium.com/@posey).

ðŸ“ˆ I also spend my time working on [Spawner](https://www.spawner.ai), open tools and data for traders and investors.
